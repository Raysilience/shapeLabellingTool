## Sketch labelling tool
This project is meant to provide an auto-labelling tool to speed up the labelling process of the hand-sketch geometric shape category and its corresponding vertices position. 
Its UI is based on `pygame` and the auto-labelling algorithms mainly use `opencv`.

## Usage
1. Install all the dependencies
2. Run `main.py`
3. Drag your mouse to draw shapes. After you finish drawing, the result will be automatically shown on the right-side panel.
4. Click the button to change category.
5. Click vertices on the screen in a clockwise order to modify their positions.
